In this video, I walk you through an analysis of our hotel booking data set, focusing on key insights for our stakeholders. 
We discovered that guests without children actually book further in advance and also stay the most weekend nights, which confirms our hypothesis. 
Additionally, we found that the majority of bookings come from travel agents, particularly for city hotels. 
I filtered the data to identify high-value bookings, revealing that August is our top month for these bookings.
